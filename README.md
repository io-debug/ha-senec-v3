- Select the Integration Type (basically LAN ot WebApi)
- LAN: (`SENEC.Home V3 hybrid/SENEC.Home V3 hybrid duo` or `SENEC.Home V2.1 or older`
  or `Internal inverter build into SENEC.Home V3 hybrid/hybrid duo`)
    - Provide display name for the device, and it's address (hostname or IP)
    - Provide the update intervall
    - Provide area where the battery is located
- WebAPI (`WEB.API: mein-senec.de Portal (usable with all SENEC.Home variants)`
  or `SENEC.Home V4/SENEC.Home V4 hybrid`):
    - Provide display name for the device
    - Provide your mein-senec.de login credentials

## Functional Overview

### Supported Devices

The following devices are currently supported:

| Device                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SENEC.HOME&nbsp;V2.x   | You can use the features and sensors provided by your device via the local polling (via lala.cgi) and the Web API (via mein-senec.de)                                                                                                                                           | 
| SENEC.HOME&nbsp;V3     | You can use the features and sensors provided by your device via the local polling (via lala.cgi) and the Web API (via mein-senec.de)                                                                                                                                           | 
| SENEC.HOME&nbsp;V4     | Since the device does not provide local access via a build in webserver, you can just use the features and sensors provided via the Web API (via mein-senec.de).                                                                                                                | 
| SENEC.Inverter&nbsp;V3 | [When you have connected the internal inverter(s) with your LAN](#build-in-inverters), you will be able to access information via the Local API. Please see: "Connecting the internal (build in) SENEC Inverter Hardware to your LAN and use it in HA" for further information. | 

### Local Polling

The following features and sensors are provided by polling the build in webserver of your SENEC device: Since this is a
long list, not everything is enabled by default.
To enable a disabled function or sensor navigate to Settings -> Devices and Services, select the integration and click
"configuration" of the device. In the list you can see the status and have also the option to enable/disable them.

## Connecting the internal (build in) SENEC Inverter Hardware to your LAN and use it in HA

The __SENEC.Home V3 hybrid duo__ have build in two inverters - called LV and HV. This hardware has its own LAN
connectors, but they have not been connected during the installation process (I guess by purpose).

### __DO THIS ON YOUR OWN RISK!__

Nevertheless, when you dismount the front and the right hand side panels you simply can plug in RJ45 LAN cables into
both of the inverters LAN connectors and after a short while you should be able to access the web frontends of the
inverters via your browser.

_Don't forget to assign fixed IP's to the additional inverter hardware. You can unplug the LAN cable for a short while
in order to make sure that the inverters will make use of the fixed assigned IP's._

### Position of SENEC.Inverter V3 LV LAN connector

![img|160x90](images/inv_lv.png)
On the front of the device

### Position of SENEC.Inverter V3 HV LAN connector _(hybrid duo only!)_

![img|160x90](images/inv_hv.png)
On the right hand side of the device

### Adding Inverter(s) to your HA

Once you have connected the inverter(s) with your LAN you can add another integration entry to your SENEC Integration in
Home Assistant:

1. go to '__Settings__' -> '__Devices & Services__'
2. select the '__SENEC.Home__' integration.
3. there you find the '__Add Entry__' button (at the bottom of the '__Integration entries__' list)
4. select `Internal inverter build into SENEC.Home V3 hybrid/hybrid duo` from the list
5. specify the IP (or hostname) of the inverter you want to add
6. __important:__ assign a name (e.g. _INV_LV_).

Repeat step 3, 4 & 5 of this procedure, if you have build in two inverters into your SENEC.Home.

## Home Assistant Energy Dashboard

This integration supports Home Assistant's [Energy Management](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/).
To use the Energy Dashboard please set up the Web API first.
In the description of the Web API you will see which sensors you can use for the Energy Dashboard.

Example setup:

| [@marq24](https://github.com/marq24)         | @marq24 created this fork, e.g. added several sensors and functions and is maintaining the integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [@mstuettgen](https://github.com/mstuettgen) | Provided the initial WEB-API implementation for SENEC.Home V4 web access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [@io-debug](https://github.com/io-debug)     | Provided the initial developer documentation and added functionality like the spare capacity management.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [@mchwalisz](https://github.com/mchwalisz)   | This fork was created from [mchwalisz/home-assistant-senec](https://gitgub.com/mchwalisz/home-assistant-senec) since with latest updates of the firmware introduced by SENEC the original integration simply does not work anylonger - plus: we needed more detailed information and configuration options |
